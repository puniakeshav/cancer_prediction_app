  InfoItem(head: "About", body: "Epidermal growth factor receptor(EGFR) is a trans-membrane glycoprotein with an extracellular epidermal growth factor binding domain and an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain that regulates signaling pathways to control cellular proliferation. Epidermal growth factor receptor binding to its ligand results in autophosphorylation by intrinsic tyrosine/kinase activity, triggering several signal transduction cascades. Constitutive or sustained activation of these sequences of downstream targets is thought to yield more aggressive tumor phenotypes. "),
  InfoItem(head: "Gene structure", body: "The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a single-chain transmembrane protein comprised of an extracellular EGF-binding domain, a short transmembrane sequence, and a cytoplasmic region that incorporates a protein tyrosine kinase domain and a C-terminal phosphorylation domain. "),
  InfoItem(head: "EGFR(mutation)", body: "It has an extracellular ligand binding domain, a transmembrane portion, and intracellular tyrosine kinase and regulatory domains. Upon binding of a specific ligand (eg. epidermal growth factor), the normally functioning EGFR undergoes conformational change and phosphorylation of the intracellular domain occurs, leading to downstream signal transduction by various pathways."),

ALK is also a candidate thinness gene, as its genetic deletion leads to resistance to diet- and leptin-mutation-induced obesity."),

These rearrangements are somatic mutations, which means they occur during a persons lifetime and are present only in the cells that become cancerous"),

  InfoItem(head: "Testing for NTRK Fusion Genes", body: "The NTRK gene fusion is rare, despite occurring in several cancer types. For example, in lung and colorectal cancers, prevalence of the NTRK fusions is well below 5%.To confirm a cancer patient has a mutation, a biopsy, blood, hair, or skin sample is collected. Then, in a laboratory, specific changes in chromosomes, DNA, and proteins are observed. However, for the NTRK fusion genes, there are tests available that identify only the presence of NTRK genes."),
  InfoItem(head: "Drug therapies", body: "Targeted therapies interfere with the created TRK fusion proteins to block them from contributing to cancer cell growth. Because these gene mutations are rare and they are found in various cancer types, some clinical trials are available for more than one cancer. There are only two FDA approved targeted drug therapies available for NTRK1/2/3 gene fusions, which include: Entrectinib and Larotrectinib.")

Some cancer cells have high amounts of PDL1. This allows the cancer cells to trick the immune system, and avoid being attacked as foreign, harmful substances."),

A tumor may be PD-L1 negative because it has no T cell infiltrate, which may be reversed with an immune response. Finally, a tumor that is unable to express PD-L1 because of a genetic event will always be negative for PD-L1 on cancer cells."),
